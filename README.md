# Profiler

Profiler is a command line application that creates a pdf resume of your GitHub profile.
I used the following libraries: inquirer, puppeteer, and handlebars.

Inquirer - was used to allow for the creation of the command line application by asking questions and providing error feedback.

Puppeteer - makes it easy to generate a pdf from the page content
