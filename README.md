# Profiler

Profiler is a command line application that creates a pdf resume of your GitHub profile by asking a few key questions.
I used the following libraries: inquirer, html-pdf and axios.


NOTE: Had several issues trying to get this to work. Turning in assignment, but will resolve later. 

Able o resolve the broken code 12/17 and pdf is now generated.
